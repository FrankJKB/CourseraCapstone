    "In this project, we are helping a friend who lives in **Montreal** to move to another neighborhood within the city. He asked us to suggest to him a neighborhood which is relatively similar to the one he lives in now in terms of **population density and the proximity of restaurants, shops and venues**. Furthermore, he has a **budget range of \\\\$350 000 to \\\\$500 000** for his new property and he is looking for **at least 3 bedrooms**. He has been living for several years in *CÃ´te des Neiges*, a neighborhood located in the center of Montreal's island, but needs a change. The data science tools we learned will help us narrow down the optimal neighborhoods for him, by using a clustering model."

The demographic information is found from the last [Montreal Census data (from 2016)](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=6897,68149701&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL). The data is already available as a .CSV file and provides the population density by neighborhood. Property prices and their number of rooms are found for properties on sale on the [duProprio website](https://duproprio.com/en/search/list?search=true&regions%5B0%5D=6&min_price=200000&max_price=500000&rooms=3~3&is_for_sale=1&with_builders=1&parent=1&pageNumber=1&sort=-published_at). The required data will be scraped from the site using the **Beautiful Soup package**. Finally, the proximity and density of venues by neighborhood is found using the **Foursquare API**. Coordinates of each neighborhood are determined from the **Google Geocoding API**. "
